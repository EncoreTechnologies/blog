Welcome to the Encore DevOps blog!

We on the DevOps team have been working for about a year and a half building 
tons of automation solutions for Encore's Managed Services customers. Up until 
now we haven't had a place to publicly showcase the more technical work that 
we've been doing. This blog serves as a new space for our engineers to share 
their experiences around new and innovating technologies we're exploring.

Please stay tuned, and subscribe to our RSS feed on the left!
